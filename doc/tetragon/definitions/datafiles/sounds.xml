	SOUND DEFINITION FILE
	Defines sound and sound group resources.
	=====================================================================================
	Sounds:
	id					Unique resource ID of the sound.
	audioType			The type of the ausio file, stream or sequenced.
	volume				Volume of the sound, a value from 0.0 to 1.0.
	pan					Panning of the sound, a value from -1.0 to 1.0.
	startOffset			Start offset in ms.
	loops				Nr. of times to loop the sound. 0 is one-shot, -1 is endless.
	loopStartOffset		Start offset in ms. at which the loop starts.
	loopEndOffset		End offset in ms. at which the loop ends.
	fadeInDuration		Duration in seconds that the sound takes to reach full volume.
	fadeOutDuration		Duration in seconds that the sound takes to reach muted volume.
	audioID				ID of the audio file resource that is associated with the sound.
	=====================================================================================
	name				Only for music definitions, an optional name for the music for
						displaying in-game.
	=====================================================================================
	Sound Groups:
	id					Unique resource ID of the sound group.
	loops				The number of times the whole sound group should loop.
	playMode			Playback mode of the sound group. One of the following:
						"forward", "backward", "pingpong", "random" or "triggered".
						Sounds in the group are played according to the order that they
						are placed in the group and the specified play mode.
	noRandomRepeats		If playmode is "random" this value can be set to true to
						prevent a sound from being played twice successively.
	pauseMinDuration	
	pauseMaxDuration	These can be used to determine a pause between sounds played
						in the group. If both min and max are 0, no pause occurs, if
						both values are different a random value will be calculated
						between min and max duration.
