	CELL DEFINITION
	Think of a cell as a mini-map. The entire game is made up of cells, for a huge
	continuous world. As the player moves around, cells are loaded and unloaded from
	the game. 
	=====================================================================================
	id						The unique resource ID of the cell.
	type					The type of the cell, either exterior (e) or interior (i).
	mapID					The ID of the tilemap/3dmap associated with this cell.
	bgAudioID				ID of a soundloop that plays in this cell.
	musicGroupID			ID of a music group that is used in this cell.
	waterID					ID of water type used in this cell.
	=====================================================================================
	name					Name of the cell for display in-game.
	=====================================================================================
	ownership.actorID		ID of an actor who is the owner of this cell.
	ownership.factionID		ID of a faction that is the owner of this cell. A cell can
							only have an actor owner OR a faction owner, not both!
	ownership.factionRank	If owner is a faction this determines the faction rank
							required to enter this cell without commiting a trespassing.
	=====================================================================================
	flags.allowFastTravel	If false, no fast-travel is allowed from this cell.
	flags.allowWait			If set to false, waiting is not allowed in this cell.
	flags.publicArea		If checked, no one will ever be considered trespassing in
							the cell, but all objects in the cell still inherit the
							cell ownership and so cannot be freely taken.
	flags.offLimits			If checked, anyone caught trespassing will immediately be
							considered committing a crime (instead of being warned as
							with normal trespassing behavior).
