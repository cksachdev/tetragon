								actors, they will flee instead).

								0: Helps Nobody (will not help anyone),
								1: Helps Allies (will only help Allies),
								2: Helps Friends (will help Friends and Allies),
								3: Helps Anyone (will help anyone).

								1: Brave (will avoid/flee from threats only if severely outmatched),
								2: Average (will avoid/flee from threats that are stronger than him),
								3: Cautious (will avoid/flee from threats unless he's stronger),

								in combat under any circumstances).
			energy				Determines how often the actor moves to a new location when executing
								AI packages, and may or may not modify the distance it will allow to
								accumulate between itself and the actor it is following. This is a
								percentual value from 0 to 100.

								creature will initiate combat. If the target moves to within half
								the aggro radius, the creature initiates combat immediately.

								Package - the actor will warn and then attack any Neutral or Enemy
								that comes within the Aggro Radius.
			packages			This is the list of packages this actor will run. See Packages for
								more information. the order the packages are listed is the order
								of priority in that packages are executed.
