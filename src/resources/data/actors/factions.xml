		FLAGS
		
		hidden			If this is set to true, the faction never appears on the player's
						sheet, even if he is a member.
		outlaw			The faction is considered wanted by law enforcement. An NPC that
						belongs only to evil factions is not protected by the laws. Any crime
						committed against an evil NPC does not create bounty. The player can
						steal from or murder such NPCs with impunity. If an NPC belongs to
						both evil and non-evil factions, crimes committed against him will
						generate bounty.
